# Trees in Java

Trees are abstract data types that can be implemented using LinkedList. 
They are used to managed data in a hierarchical way making them
extremely efficient. The concept behind trees deals with nodes, which
each object in the ADT is represented as in the form of key-value pairs.
The first node of the tree is referred to as the _root_, where all operations begin.

There are several types of trees but the most common is the Binary Tree, which 
has two main child nodes to the left and the right. If the node key is
less than the root's then the object is placed to the left, and to the right if
greater. For trees performance is measured based on the insertion and 
retrieval of data.
